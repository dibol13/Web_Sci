Getting the JSON data out of the document was te most difficult part, specifically the hashtag data due to the fact that hashtag data is only stored if there is one and if there was no hashtag the structure of the array holding that data is non-existant.

My CSS is not the best, and my design skills are lacking as of right now.

I decided to use a JQuery fade animation over CSS3 animations due to my comfort with JQuery over CSS animations. I decided to fade through the information and not shift any of the divs but used a delay to make it look more like a change in div.
